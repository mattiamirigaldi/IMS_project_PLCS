Capire come Implementare userdata model per tutti i servizi offerti --> al login prendere i dati con http

1) finish the profile customization => NOT USING CUSTOMER SINCE REQUIRES TIME TO GET USED TO IT 
Basically only one service at login get all the data and then needed to make it customazible when making changes on it 
2) finish web services  => login as operator/login as supervisor/add operator services ( add/remove book, add/remove customer, modify book)/add supervisor services ( register an operator )
Isn't easier to retrieve all the user data once al login and then use it in all the functions instead of always calling the httpservices ??

3) Feed dashboard!!!!!

--> Change paradigm of user using the mycustomer function
--> Change registration adding possibility of putting picture
--> Implementare tutti i servizi in dashboard


4) Start to work with tables and organize better the work in flask


optional :
--> adding in user info the numbers of read book,number of book booked
